# Arduino UNO with Gyroscope:

# Description
A gyroscope sensor measures the angular velocity and orientation of an object. When combined with an Arduino UNO, it can be used in various applications such as motion detection, stabilization, and navigation systems. One commonly used gyroscope sensor is the MPU-6050, which combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer.

# Components Needed
- Arduino UNO
- MPU-6050 gyroscope module
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

# Instructions

1. **Connect the MPU-6050 to the Breadboard:**
   - Insert the MPU-6050 module into the breadboard.

2. **Wire the MPU-6050 to the Arduino:**
   - Connect VCC on the MPU-6050 to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect GND on the MPU-6050 to the GND pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect SCL on the MPU-6050 to the A5 pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect SDA on the MPU-6050 to the A4 pin on the Arduino.

3. **Power the Arduino:**
   - Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

4. **Observe the Data:**
   - To read data from the MPU-6050, you typically need to upload a sketch to the Arduino. However, here's a simple setup to ensure everything is connected correctly without using code.
